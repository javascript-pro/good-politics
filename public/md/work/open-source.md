### Open Source software is made by people just like you

> Tips for self-care and avoiding burnout as a maintainer.

#### Identify your motivations for working in open source

Take time to reflect on what parts of open source maintenance energizes you. Understanding your motivations can help you prioritize the work in a way that keeps you engaged and ready for new challenges. Whether it’s the positive feedback from users, the joy of collaborating and socializing with the community, or the satisfaction of diving into the code, recognizing your motivations can help guide your focus.

#### Reflect on what causes you to get out of balance and stressed out

It’s important to understand what causes us to get burned out. Here are a few common themes we saw among open source maintainers:

Lack of positive feedback: Users are far more likely to reach out when they have a complaint. If everything works great, they tend to stay silent. It can be discouraging to see a growing list of issues without the positive feedback showing how your contributions are making a difference.


#### GitHub Team

If you're a legit developer, you are welcome to acccess. It just isn't yet Open Source because it's not cleaned up, bullet proof and easily installable
